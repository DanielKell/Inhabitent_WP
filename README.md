# Project Learnings/Takeaways

Due to the large scope of this project, it was difficult at the beginning to grasp how all the pieces would fit together. Once the template hierarchy structure made sense it became easier to put all the bits in place. As this was the first project I've worked on that required a grasp of so many different files it was hard to manage, but after working with it for a while I picked up speed and got a thorough grasp of how everything worked in unison. This was an excellent learning tool for building PHP templates for wordpress sites!

The project also required a large amount of CSS for styling across all the different templates and pages, so was a great mental exercise in working with positioning and styling. I definitely feel much more adept and fast with CSS after this project.
